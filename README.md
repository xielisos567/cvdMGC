#The CAMGC includes the data of nonredundant CVD associated genes, seed database and the redundant CVD associated genes.
#Before conducting sequence alignment, users can first replace the spaces in gene names with underscores to achieve the purpose for gene and species annotation. For metabolic gene clusters(MGCs) annotation, the redundant CVD associated gene database is recommended.
