## Introduction
The cvdMGC database includes the data of redundant/non-redundant CVD associated genes and seed database. The cardioMASH toolkit worked based on the redundant gene dataset of cvdMGC.

Before conducting sequence alignment, users can first replace the spaces of gene names with underscores to achieve the purpose of species- or strain-level gene annotation. For strain-level metabolic gene cluster(MGC) annotation, the redundant CVD associated gene dataset should be used.
